As a hobby I solve problems. Competitive Programming like problems.

This is where I put my solutions.

I try to write comments to clarify the steps, decisions, algorithms ..., the code for
better understanding, for me and you.
Its said that when you write some code only you and God know what it does. And after five
months only God knows. Lets avoid that.

Check it out. Try solving some problems, its exciting to get an AC.

I am open to suggestions on wich to solve next, just open an issue and let me know.

Feel free to use my code as you like. A would appreciate a mention however.

If you any doubt, question, suggestion, or just want to talk, let me know: open an issue.
